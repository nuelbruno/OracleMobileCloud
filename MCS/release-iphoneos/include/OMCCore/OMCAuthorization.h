 Module responsible for handling OAuth 2.0, Basic Authentication, and in the future
 other authentication modes.  API allows for authentication, validity check,
 refresh (if applicable) and logout.  Optionally, the underlying toolkit supplies
 a login dialog to get the user ID and  password.
 
 In the documentation below, the term "authentication" refers to what is appropriate
 for the authentication type in use.  For OAuth, authentication acquires an OAuth
 token, whereas for Basic Authentication, the authentication simply validates that
 the user/password combination is correct.
 
 Note an OMCAuthorization instance is capable of holding only one valid set of
 authentication credentials at a time, so subsequent calls to acquire a token
 will overwrite any previous token that has not been released.  The methods
 in this class are not thread-safe, so the caller must use appropriate
 synchronization methods when the potential for concurrent invocation exists.
 For methods that use asynchronous callbacks, the lifetime of the concurrency
 includes completion of the user callback.
 
 Note to Swift developers: for full visibility to all the API's in this class,
 add the following headers to your Objective-C bridging header:
 OMCUser.h from the Core library (this module), plus OMAuthView.h and
 OMDefinitions.h from the IDM Security Library.  The latter two may be found in
 the "PublicHeaders" folder under the thirdParty distributions folder of the release.
